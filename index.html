            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img id="bowl" src="bowl.png">
            <p>Hi! I'm Gabe. I was born and raised here in South Burlington. I graduated from South Burlington High School in 2016 and now am a rising senior at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.
                I plan to graduate with a Mathematics major and Russian minor in the spring of 2020. My math work at Bates, and most notably my research in the summer of 2018 on Origami Rings
                helped me realize how much progamming interests me. Writing code in Maple (an academic mathematical programming software) showed me how similar writing code is to solving a math problem.
            </p>    
            <p>When I'm home, I live with my parents, sister, and cat. I love the friendly, small-town culture of the Burlington area, as well as the beatiful landscape that surrounds us.
                Living here is great and I hope to be able to stay here as long as possible!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy making pottery, biking, playing the euphonium (a low brass instrument) and playing video games with friends. I have been making pottery since I was young,
                but I am by no means an expert. It has been sort of an on and off activity for me that I want to do more. I wish I could spend more time with ceramics, but it is often expensive or difficult to get studio access.
                I love listening to and playing all sorts of music. I started playing the piano in 2nd grade and began playing the euphonium in 6th grade. While I no longer play the piano, I still play
                the euphonium in the Brass Ensemble at Bates. I have a lot of fun playing video games, which has made me interested in topics like game design and game theory.

            <h3>Burlington Code Academy</h3>
            <img id="bca-img" src="bca.png">
            <p>The Burlington Code Academy (BCA) is a coding bootcamp located in Burlington, Vermont. Created by Alex Horner and Benjamin Boas with classes taught primarily by Joshua Burke, 
                BCA teaches the basics and essentials of front end web development to a small class of less than 20 students over the course of 12 weeks, meeting every weekday from 9am to 5pm.
                Lessons are highly interactive, and the class is project based. Every week, students work either alone or in groups to complete a project based upon the material learned that week.
                At the end of the course, students work in groups on a large project for a business or government, spending approximately three weeks using their skills to solve a problem by developing an app.
            </p>
            <p>I am currently taking the course, and here are the projects I've completed so far:</p>
