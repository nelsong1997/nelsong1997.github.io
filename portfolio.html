                            this game as part of the curriculum of my capstone seminar

                            Playing by hand can be tedious and takes a while, so I decided as a personal project to turn the game into a web app that
                            also automatically records data in both a graph and a table.

                            pseudo-randomness. Unlike other apps I've created, this app was designed with aesthetics and mobile access in mind.

                        <p>
                            To use, click or touch the screen to start choosing a random color. To reset, click/touch and hold. While on

                            my group's capstone project was to build a web app for <a href="https://hopeworksvt.org/">Hope Works</a>, a non-profit

                            sexual and domestic violence. My two main focuses for this project were the form that volunteers and employees fill out
                            to document interactions with survivors and the page that sorts and displays submitted forms. Note that this is a
                            re-creation of these two parts of this project for demo purposes, so some features are altered or unavailable.

                            The softwares I'm interested in creating are basically tools, even if they are small parts of much bigger tools. 
                            They are used to make some task simpler, faster, or less
                            frustrating. No matter what I end up doing, I want to be helping people in some way. While I would ideally love to work
                            on projects that help people in difficult life situations or that help make our society more equitable, I would settle 
                            for making people's day to day lives easier by making the apps they use every day more effective and easier to use. That
                            being said, I definitely don't want to work for any company that is exploitative, deceptive, or predatory in any way.

                            A lot of software companies nowadays use terms like <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> to describe
                            their workplace environment, but not all workplaces
                            that claim to follow these types of philosophies actually follow through. To me, it doesn't matter what you call it:
                            I'm for collaborative, adaptable, and functional development where teammates respect and support one another. This will
                            be essential to me especially as I start off, since I am partially a self-taught programmer and I am not aware of a lot
                            of conventions or best practice solutions to problems. While I'll pick these up quickly once I'm on the job, responsive
                            and helpful mentors will be a vital part of my learning.

                            Henry Boateng</a> had an eccentric personality, a wonderful sense of humor, and an infectious laugh, but his homework
                            problems were often quite challenging! In order to solve them, I had to work with newly made friends in groups
                            for hours on end. While it was difficult, it felt so rewarding to work together to tackle tricky problems. 
                            Eventually I realized I wanted to be a Mathematics major because of my passion for problem solving. That same
                            passion drives me to problem solve through programming, in which the problem solving process is often quite
                            similar.

                        <h2>Biking</h2>
                        <p>
                            While I've always enjoyed biking, I've really started biking a lot more since I bought a used road bike last summer. I
                            used it to commute to Burlington Code Academy from home. For me, it's a great way to get outside and enjoy our beautiful
                            community and get some exercise.

                        <h2>Music</h2>
                        <p>
                            I love both playing and listening to music. I've been playing music since 2nd grade, and I have played the piano, recorder,
                            clarinet, and euphonium. In college I played in the <a
                            href="https://www.bates.edu/music/the-brass-ensemble/">Bates Brass Ensemble</a> (pictured below). Most of my enjoyment comes 
                            from playing as part of a group, but I don't know if I'll have
                            any opportunities to continue playing in an ensemble now that I've graduated.
